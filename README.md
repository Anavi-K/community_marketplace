The Home Screen is composed of three main UI elements: a Header, a collection of ProductCard components, and a scrollable layout container. The Header provides a simple, centered title to maintain clarity and brand identity. The ProductCard component was designed as a reusable visual block, containing a placeholder image box and text areas for the name and price. A scrollable layout (ScrollView) was chosen to allow smooth navigation through multiple product cards. The overall layout decisions focus on simplicity, readability, and preparing the project structure for future enhancements such as Firestore integration, navigation, and dynamic data rendering.
